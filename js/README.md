# Pravda Dashboard - World Map

## Context & Acknowledgments

The Pravda Dashboard World Map is a collaborative effort between [@DFRLab](https://www.dfrlab.org) and [@CheckFirstHQ](https://www.checkfirst.network), aimed at reverse-engineering and visualizing the Pravda Network—a well-established Russian disinformation network initially reported by Viginum.

## The Pravda Network World Map

This repository hosts the code for visuals accompanying a piece published on the DFRLab website, illustrating the global footprint of the Pravda Network.

For deeper insights into the tactics employed by this network and the countries it targets, refer to DFRLab's detailed blog post.

The repository leverages libraries such as D3.js, Plotly, and Leaflet. Additional resources include the CSS merge loader by [jh3y](https://jheytompkins.com). The remaining code is written in vanilla Javascript.
